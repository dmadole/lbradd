# lbradd.sh

This is a simple shell script that will add a file to an Elf/OS lbr archive. If called with an archive filename that does not exist, a new archive is created; if called with an archive filename that does exist, the file is added to the existing archive.

This has only been tested under the Bash shell, I am not sure if it will work on other shells.
